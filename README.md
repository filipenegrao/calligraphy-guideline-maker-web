# Calligraphy Guideline Maker (web version)

About
The idea for this page came from laziness to design different guidelines every time I wanted to practice a new alphabet or when I changed the size of the nib. Also came through my motivation to try to understand a new programming language for me (Javascript). The first prototype of this application was developed in the great DrawBot tool and then transferred to Canvas by using another fantastic tool, Codepen.

How to use
Using this tool is simple and you should just pay attention to the units of measurement. 
The width of the nib is given in millimeters, the angle of the pen in degrees (not in radians) and the alphabet proportions should be placed in pen widths.
